        <p className="mb-4">
          We believe in the power of visual communication to convey complex ideas in their simplest form. Our black and
          white aesthetic strips away distraction, allowing the core concept to shine through.

          Each visual is designed to communicate a single, powerful idea that can be understood at a glance, but
          contemplated for a lifetime.
