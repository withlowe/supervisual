# Find Your Place

Leverage is as much about where you are standing as how much force you are applying.

The most effective people understand that positioning is often more important than effort. They focus on finding the right place to apply their skills and energy, rather than simply working harder in a suboptimal position.

## The Power of Position

When Archimedes said, "Give me a lever long enough and a fulcrum on which to place it, and I shall move the world," he wasn't just talking about physics. He was describing a universal principle that applies to all forms of influence and impact.

In business, this might mean:

- Finding an underserved market niche
- Developing a unique skill set that few others possess
- Building relationships with key decision-makers
- Positioning yourself at the intersection of multiple growing trends

## Application

Ask yourself:

1. Where am I currently applying force in my life or work?
2. Is this the optimal position for maximum leverage?
3. What small shifts in position might dramatically increase my impact?
4. Am I working hard in the wrong place when I could work less in the right place?

Remember that sometimes the most productive thing you can do is to stop pushing and reassess your position.
